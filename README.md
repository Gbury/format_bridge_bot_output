# format_bridge_bot_output
Intercepts messages before WeeChat displays them and if found to have been sent by a bridge bot proceeds to alter the message so that when displayed it has the appearance of being sent by a native IRC user.

I wrote a blog post to accompany this script when I first released it in November 2018: [WeeChat IRC Client - Formatting Bridge Bot Output](https://www.thecliguy.co.uk/2018/11/18/weechat-format-bridge-bot-output-script)
